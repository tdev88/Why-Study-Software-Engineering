    <p class="clearfix">With over 17 years experience working in and managing IT operational teams, I have specialised in incident management, service management including governance and compliance, and process improvement across a range of industries namely retail, health, national critical infrastructure, and mining. Most recently I led the IT change control function at Newcrest Mining for two years and was then appointed to govern the IT project and IT risk management space at the start of 2020. While I was very capable at carrying out these roles, my heart just wasn't in it so much so that a few years ago, I even told myself that I didn't want to work in the IT sector anymore. Yet I had no plan as to what I should do instead...</p>

    <p class="clearfix">In the middle of March 2020, a global pandemic occurred and I was sent home to work, as were millions of others around the world. Another experience I shared with the collective was re-evaluating my career and the direction I wanted to take it in. Thankfully, my keen interest in blockchain technology provided some signposts. I began to research what roles I could do in the blockchain sector and I came across blockchain app development. A senior blockchain developer on YouTube, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienklepatch/">Julien Kapatch</a>, was adamant that anyone could learn this skill with a bit of dedication and hard work. He also advised that a good foundation in web devlopment was essential before moving on to developing apps to run on blockchains.</p>

    <P class="clearfix">I dipped my toe in with HTML and CSS Essentials tutorials via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn_Learning">LinkedIn Learning</a> which was provided by my former employer. I was enjoying it so decided to take my education to the next level and find a reputable learning provider to deliver a structured and high quality programme. After some further research, I spoke to a course advisor who seemed genuinely interested in my goal and in making sure I was choosing the right programme to enrol in. That's how I came to be a Software Engineering student at <a href="https://academyxi.com/">Academy Xi.</a></P>
